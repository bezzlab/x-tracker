    <p align="center">X-Tracker is a new piece of software allowing Mass Spectrometry-based protein quantitation.<br>
       Through an abstraction of the main steps involved in quantitation, X-Tracker is able to support<br>
       quantitation by means of all the current protocols, both at MS or Tandem MS level, and provide<br>
       a flexible, platform-independent and easy-to-use quantitation environment</p>
