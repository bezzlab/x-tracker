#summary Getting started with X-Tracker.

= Welcome to X-Tracker =

Welcome to X-Tracker, a software framework for supporting mass spectrometry-based protein and peptide quantitation.

Note that this (Google Code) site is specifically designed for those people developing X-Tracker's core program code and plugins. There is a separate, much more accessible, site aimed at users over at www.x-tracker.info. At that site you can find user guides, tutorials and an easy to install x-tracker package.
